- Created a diseases prediction and diagnosis model using machine learning models.    
- Uses various classification models like KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM to predict the disease based on the symptoms provided by the user.    
- Used ensemble learning model to get the most voted result out of all four models.     
- Created rest api using flask to handle query from frontend built using react.   
- API end point:- http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict   
- Sample body for api-   
{   
    "symptoms" : ["cold_hands_and_feets", "restlessness"]   
}
